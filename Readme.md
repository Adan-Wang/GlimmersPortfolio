# Star Glimmers

Star Glimmers is a Discord support bot for a Discord server that I help run. The main purpose of the bot is more geared towards role assignment and utilities.

# PLEASE NOTE

To protect the privacy of those who are involved, many database this program relies on has been redacted. 

As such, this program will NOT work (there will be syntax errors and components missing) as is, only the core algorithms and logics have been kept as a showcase project. Please don't try to run this.


# Functionalities

## Add Role
Glimmers have the function to assign role to members using the "reactions" feature on Discord. Upon restart, it will automatically fetch the corresponding message to ensure this functionality is not disrupted if the internet goes out.


## Show Resources
Glimmers have a repository of links that may be use to the users of the Discord server (e.g. FAQs).
